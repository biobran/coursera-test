		<h2>Physics	and	Einstein circa 1900:Selected Events	and	Trends of Significance in Physics, 1800-1900</h2>
			<h3>1800-1807	(wave	theory	of	light):</h3>
				<p>Research	by	Thomas	Young	of	England	on	interference	and	other	effects	in light	that	leads him	to	develop	a	wave	theory	of	light,	attributed	to	the	vibrations	of	an	ether.</p>
			<h3>1831	(electromagnetic	induction):</h3>
				<p>Michael	Faraday	of	England	shows	that	a	moving	magnet	may	generate	an	
				electric	current	(e.g.,	a	bar	magnet	that	moves	through	a	closed	coil	of	wire).</p>
			<h3>1860s-1870s	(Maxwell’s	equations	and	EM	nature	of	light):</h3>
				<p>William	Thomson	and	James	Clerk	Maxwell	
				mathematize	and	extend	Faraday’s	notion	of	an	electromagnetic	field,	resulting	in	Maxwell’s	laws	of	
				electromagnetism	and	the	theoretical	realization	that	light	was	an	electromagnetic	phenomenon	(a	wave).</p>
			<h3>1870s-1900s	(mechanical	reduction):</h3>
				<p>Following	Maxwell’s	successes,	British	physicists	seek	to	describe	the	 electromagnetic	field	and	related	phenomena	via	elaborate	mechanical	models	of	the	ether.	This	program
				eventually	develops into	a	uniquely	British	style	of	doing physics;	the	French,	who	prize	clarity	of	thought,
				compare the	British	approach	to	an	ugly	factory,	though	they	too	practice methods	of	reducing	all	phenomena to	mechanical	phenomena	and/or	equations,	just	in	what	they	consider	more	elegant	ways.</p>
			<h3>1879	(Einstein	born):	</h3>
				<p>	Albert	Einstein	born	to	Hermann	and	Pauline	Einstein	on	March	14,	1879	in	Ulm,	Germany.	
				He	was	their	first	child.	After	moving	to	Munich	in	1880,	a	daughter,	Maria	(or	Maja),	is	born	in	1881.</p>
			<h3>1887	(Michelson-Morley	null	result):</h3>
				<p>Using	a	setup	that	took	advantage	of	the	interference	effects	of	two	light	
				beams	(an	interferometer),	Albert	Michelson	and	Edward	Morley	of	the	United	States	announce	that	they	
				found	no	evidence	for	the	effect	of	an	ether	wind	on	the	velocity	of	light.</p>
			<h3>1889	(FitzGerald	contraction):</h3>
				<p>Based	on	Maxwellian	theory,	the	work	of	Oliver	Heaviside	on	the	electric	field	of	
				a	high-velocity	moving	charge,	and	the	idea	that intermolecular	forces	are	electromagnetic	in	nature,	George	
				Francis	FitzGerald	proposes	the	movement	of	all	bodies	through	the	ether	causes	them	to	contract	along	the	line	of	motion,	thus	explaining	the	null	result	of	Michelson	and	Morley</p>
			<h3>1905 (The	miracle	year):</h3>
				<p>Still	at	the	Patent	Office,	Einstein	publishes	five	papers.	One	paper	provides a	longsought
				convincing	argument	for	the	existence	of	atoms,	one	would	become	one	of	the	most	cited	papers	of	its	
				time,	one	shakes physicist’s understanding	of	the	foundations	of	physical	reality,	one remakes the	notions	of	
				space	and	time,	and	the	final	one	introduces the	most	recognized	equation	in	history. It	would	be	another	four years,	however,	before	Einstein	is able	to	attain	a	university	position	in	physics	and	leave	the	Patent	Office.</p>
